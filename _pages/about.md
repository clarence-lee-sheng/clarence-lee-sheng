Hello, I’m Clarence. I’m deeply interested in exploring the fundamental challenges of AI, particularly how Large Language Models (LLMs) scale across different modalities such as vision and language. LLMs exhibit intriguing log-linear scaling behaviors, though predicting their performance at scale remains a complex and ongoing challenge.

As part of the pretraining team at DSO, I focus on developing large-scale models with billions of parameters and trillions of data points. My past work also includes using Unity3D to bridge vision and language, and investigating uncertainty estimation in language models through calibration and conformal prediction techniques.

I’m driven by a passion for connecting knowledge from various fields and applying it to advance AI research, always seeking to expand my understanding of the world.
